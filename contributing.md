## Adding to this list

This list is focused on references to resources dedicated to researching and using restaking, as well as the design and development of AVSs. Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guideline:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the suggestion is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalize.com) (AP style). 
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

Thank you for your suggestions!
